# So you aren't thrilled with Skills of the Wild?

- First, that is *OK*. It is not for everyone, and it can be a bit intrusive.
- Secondly, It is a relatively easy thing to disable, though it **WILL** require a new game to do so

__To Disable Skills of the Wild__
- In the Left Pane of MO2, Uncheck the Skills of the Wild mod and Wild Concoctions, as well as the NFF Patch under general patches
- In the **RIGHT** pane of MO2, disable the Last Seed-Skills of the Wild.esp.
- Thats it! Skills of the Wild is disabled, and you are free to start your game!
